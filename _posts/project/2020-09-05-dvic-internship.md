# Internship at the DVIC

I am currently completing a rather unique Masterâ€™s degree where I have been given the liberty to work on a large project involving a drone swarm and augmented reality. As part of the De Vinci Innovation Center (Paris, France), I spent most of the last year developing a flight test platform, and then developing interaction between drones, interaction with virtual objects and with hand tracking commands. I started this platform from scratch, putting together a motion capture system, and putting in place Crazyflie drones. More about the project in this report.
