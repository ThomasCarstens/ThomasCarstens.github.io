# TO BE EDITED

## Aim
This project consisted of redesigning illuminated braaitongs to be market-competitive, but also for elegance and practicality.

## Background
Mechanical design and rendering takes place throughout the UCT's Mechanical Engineering degree.

The braai is the traditional South African open-air barbecue. These braai tongs were designed to have LED illumination but also compete with tongs currently on the market.

## Features
### Spring-loaded

### Detachable tongs

### 4 LEDS per tong

The electrical wiring was a little tough. We had after all chosen to power the LEDs on two sides with a single battery. But can this work with a spring-loaded contraption? This means the wiring for the other tong had to be designed very carefully.

## Summary
These braai tongs were designed to be ergonomic and durable - but also very fancy ones, with LED illumination and detachable extensions for cleaning and storing.
