# TO BE EDITED

## Aim
This tutorial has 2 parts: a broad theoretical basis and then a tutorial to follow. I will want my drone to bring me back a pizza (large with cheese ~= 230g ). I want to figure out the drone specifics so that it brings me back my pizza. This will require balancing all the components in terms of the final weight. The main give-and-take takes place in balancing power and performance.








# Overview of drone components

Where to start? Selecting components serves to balance drone power and performance.
However these vary depending on the specifications of all our components.
Ultimately, this is an iterative process.


# Balancing thrust to weight vs the energy needs of the drone
Battery-motors-frame take up 50-70% of the full drone weight. We can begin this process
99% of the battery is used up by motors. Once our motors are selected, we look to satisfy the energy needs of the drone


## Motors

### Start selection with hover thrust
### Motor quality
Obviously at the motors: more coils/ thicker wire means more Volts at fewer Amps thus more torque (ie. More agility e.g. turns vs sprints) however heavier.

### Selecting propellers
Propellers can also offer more torque when more surface area/angle of attack. All to be calculated according to local air density. More surface area means more battery consumption!

### Total battery consumption

## Battery
(Usually Last step) A bigger battery can either increase your flight time, or allow for unusual bursts of current (more power), but the weight returns to the TtoW ratio.

# Balancing the drone's center of gravity
The physical size of drone, and especially of battery, can affect the center of gravity.
