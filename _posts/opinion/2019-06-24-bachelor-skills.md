# ![drawing](/assets/images/favicon.jpg){: .aligned-left} How I market myself online

I studied UCT's Bsc Eng Mechanical and Mechatronics and I found it difficult to market yourself online. I have adopted **a set of approaches to self-marketing** that I think others can benefit from.

Here's the general strategy. I meet said employer. I pull out my wallet and handover a card with my website url. That directs them here (hello!).

## Some background

So I work in tech development. To find work, I soon realised that it would be useful to find ways to promote myself (e.g. this website).

The post you're reading now focuses on ways I chose to market myself as an engineer. So what should I put into my CV as a Bsc Eng(MMT)?

# A. Personal branding
An online profile is a great way to sell myself effectively.

Sections:
1. A personal website
2. My business card

## 1. A personal website
My website unifies all the parts we'll mention now. This helps to simplify management of my professional profile.

## 2. My business card
My business card helps me stay in touch with people that I meet only once. I pull out my wallet and handover a card with my website url. That directs them here (hello!).


# B. Focusing on skills
A tech employer will very often look for specific skills (especially technical skills when applying for technical roles).
What skills do I have? The question I prefer is: What value can my skills contribute to their company?

Sections:
1. Skills listed by subject/interest
2. Skills utilized in concrete projects
3. Skill keywords

## 1. Subjects on my transcript
First I looked at what skills my degree offered me.

Each subject teaches a host of areas of applications. It's difficult to pin down what skills each subject translates to. I found better ways to showcase the skills I learned during university.

## 2. Projects in my portfolio
Laying out the technical aspects of projects is a great way of displaying the level of my different skills. Ideally, employers will click on what interests them. _Click on my Portfolio tab above to get an idea of how I went about it._

How to get a portfolio up and going? There are many paid plans, but I luckily stumbled on a way to host this site for free on Github-Pages using [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Great for blogs and portfolios. Be warned: no CMS, no databasing, just static content. _Browse through this website to see what Jekyll-now has to offer._

## 3. Listing skills during an interview

Interviewers will expect from you to list your strongpoints. Here's a basic infographic that I edited many times. Categorising the skills make it easier to discuss them.

{% include gallery caption="Suggestions to categorise the skills offered by Bsc Eng (MMT)." %}

There are actually various ways of viewing the combination of your skills: I-shaped skills, T-shaped or X-shaped skills. [This article explains it better than I could.](https://trydesignlab.com/blog/how-to-get-hired-understand-if-youre-an-i-t-or-x-s/)
I see myself as T-shaped: one area of specialty, other skills, with a collaborative mindset.

I would put my skills under three broad categories.

### Technical skills
I broadly categorise my own skills as hardware and software, mechanical and mechatronic, front-end and back-end, etc.

### Project-related skills
As an engineer working towards fast deadlines and tight budgets, it is useful to have project management and technical writing skills.

### Social skills
I have been asked about my team management skills (I described challenges that occur in team situations).

# C. Focusing on experience
Other than skills, there's a different approach to self-marketing: personal experience. This can be showcased for each project separately.
Sections:
1. List of portfolio projects
2. List of jobs
3. List of business ventures

## 1. Portfolio projects
### Experience in a particular field
It is useful to showcase projects in the areas of interest of employers. For instance, a project in app development actually helped leverage me into robotic engineering. This type of experience helps show that I have knowledge about a certain field (T-skills) and that I am adaptable to further projects in said field.

### Decision-making experience
A way to show good decision-making within a project is to write about the project's constraints, limitations, success areas, and offer recommendations. This type of experience helps show that I am reliable, accountable and professional. _Click on my Portfolio tab above to get an idea of how I went about it._

## 2. Listing jobs that were done
Associating myself with certain companies/commissions/work environments definitely adds to my profile. _Check out my CV tab above to see how I went about it._

## 3. Business ventures
Business-type projects attest to the ways I take initiatives. _Check out my Ventures tab above to observe my approach._

# D. Staying current
Showcasing knowledge of the latest changes in the market, in tech, in books of a wide range of topics indicates that I am highly adaptable.
Sections:
1. Writing about current tech news
2. Testing the latest technologies

## 1. Writing about current tech news
In my field of development, staying informed of the ever-changing tech market is critical - writing about it is a work of self-promotion. _I wrote a bit about this in the [Opinion section](https://thomascarstens.github.io/#opinion) of my blog._

## 2. Testing the latest technologies
I believe that the most power tool for a developer is the ability to mix and match technologies. Once you've done and tested a technology, your ability to understand further implications of the application of the tech are beyond words.
_I have a section in my blog called Lifestyle devoted to sharing my personal projects of new tech._
